# CountAPI

This API allows you to create simple numeric counters. \
You can
- create a counter
- increment a counter
- decrement a counter

All counters are accessible if the key and site values are known (i.e. are public).

## Usage

Each counter is identified inside a **namespace** with a **key**. \
The namespace should be unique, so its recommend using your site's domain. \
Inside each namespace you can generate all the counters you may need. \
\
The hit endpoint provides increment by one counters directly. \
Each time its requested the counter will increase by one: 
```sh
https://count.aws.shangen.org/api/incr/namespace/key
â‡’ HTTP: 200 { "value": 1 }
```

## Examples
### Simple site visit counter
> Remember to change the items labeled in `{...}` to your desired site and key!
```html
<div id="visits">...</div>
```
```js
fetch('https://count.aws.shangen.org/api/incr/{shangen.org}/{visits}')
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => document.getElementById('visits').innerText = data);
```
